  The ultimate workflow tool for artisans
</p>

### Philosophy
Our mission is to assist artisans with business planning so they can focus on  what they do best — creating.

### What is WrightStream?

WrightStream is a web, tablet, and mobile application designed to make day-to-day business operations smoother for makers, builders, and crafters by automating their workflow.

##### Focused Platform

##### Simplified & Functional

##### Built for Growth


### Features

##### Workflow Dashboard
Our app imports all purchases from e-commerce sites like Etsy and Shopify and creates a dashboard that serves as a hub for everything your customers have bought from your store. Each purchase will show what products were ordered, the supplies needed and steps required to make each product, in addition to other post-production operations, such as quality check and delivery.

##### Inventory Management
Besides having an interface that guides you through the production and distribution procedures, our app also includes an inventory management system that is fully integrated with the workflow dashboard. Every time products are in queue to be crafted, supplies needed to make the products are automatically deducted from the inventory. Say goodbye to your calculator!

##### Estimator & Lists
An innovative feature we’ve decided to implement is the estimator, which is essentially a tool that calculates all the supplies you’ll need to make the products you want, all in one shopping list. This list can then be saved for when you order your supplies. Want to compare your list to your inventory first? No problem! Check this option and in stock supplies will automatically be subtracted from your list so you’re not ordering supplies you already have!

##### Staff Management
We know how difficult it is to manage more than a couple of people in a workshop setting, especially when every product is custom-made. Our app allows shop owners and managers to assign tasks to employees, which employees can then see in their personalized dashboard. That way, they can minimize distractions and focus on creating without compromising an organized workflow.
